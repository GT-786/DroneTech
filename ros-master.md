# ROS Master

* The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the rest of the nodes in the ROS system. 
* It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics as well as services.
* The role of the Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. 
* Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with each other peer-to-peer.
* The Master also provides the Parameter Server.
* The Master is most commonly run using the roscore command, which loads the ROS Master along with other essential components.
