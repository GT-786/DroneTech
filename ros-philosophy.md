# ROS Philosophy

* Peer-To-Peer: Individual programs communicates over defined API
* Distributed: Programs can run on multiple PC's and communicate over the network
* Multi-Lingual: ROS modules can be written in any language for which client library exists
* Light-Weight: Stand alone libraries are wrapped around with a thin ROS layer
* Free And Open Source
